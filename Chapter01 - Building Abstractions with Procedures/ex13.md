# Exercises 13 Chapter 1

Notice the defination of the Fibonacci sequence(in Haskell):

```haskell
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

We propose a vector sequence of two values of the Fibonacci sequence. The vector
`vfib(n)` is a 2x1 column vector which contains `fib(n)` and `fin(n-1)`. So that
the `vfib(n)` will be defined in this way(in haskell):

```haskell
vfib 0 = Matrix [[0], [0]]
vfib 1 = Matrix [[0], [0]]
vfib n = apply [[1, 1], [1, 0]] $ vfib (n - 1)
```

The matrix `[1, 1; 1, 0]` is called characteristic matrix in math, so we can
calculate the eigenvalue of this matrix, which will get this equation

```plain
x^2 = x + 1
```

The root of this equation is exactly the phi and gamma where defined in problem
previously, so the formula of the nth Fibonacci number by using the equality
`fib(b) = A \phi^n + B \gamma^n` will be expressed as follows(in python):

```python
from math import sqrt
def fibonacci(n):
    rt5 = sqrt(5.0)
    phi = (1 + rt5) * 0.5
    gamma = 1 - phi
    return 1.0 / rt5 * (phi ** n + gamma ** n)
```

Notice that the result of the nth Fibonacci number is exactly the same of the
equality in the problem.
